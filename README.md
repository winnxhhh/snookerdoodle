# Snookerdoodle

Welcome to Snookerdoodle, a web-based snooker game! This was made in January 2024 for a midterm project in school. It was my first time exploring matter.js, and I found it really fun! I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I did making it. 

To launch the game:
1. open the code in VSCode or any of your preferred IDE
2. open the code in LIVE PREVIEW
3. copy the URL generated in the live preview and paste in your desired browser (google chrome or mozilla firefox is recommended)
4. enjoy!
